1) Destroying buildings (exept if they are build on the wrong place...) is not allowed! Actualy,team destroying buildings is disabled.

2) You are allowed to build only on the "house build" zone. This is the place around the houses (the yellow-black spots) where you have to build the walls for your house. If you build on the wrong place - all of your building will be destroyed and you will be killed. So be carefull.

3) Do not freekill! Do not kill anybody for no reason,or just to get his stuff! If you got freekilled,complain to the admin. Freekillers will be killed or temp. banned.

4) Do not ask for weapons,stuff or money. If you're too poor,ask the admin for a job,he'll find you some. 

5) Be aware that the town is sometimes attacked by the union enemy forces! So be always armed and ready to kill their soldiers (NPC's),which,as we know,will try to assault the city! You will need to either get some cover,lock up in your house or some other building...or fight for your life...

6) Better get some nightvision,also,because when the night comes,you wouldn't see a shit. It's not really expencive and you can buy it in every gun shop.

7) The admin is kind person,if you're kind and not too annoying too. 

8) Have fun playing in our (mine actualy :D) Role Play server. 

9) Last,but not least,remember,that the cake is a lie.

P.S. You're stats are not saving... I'm trying to figure out how it works,and where could I get such a script,but I'm not really into it...
