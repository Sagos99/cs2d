Other Notes:
Recommending a number of players: 12/20.
Time / Location: Day / Pool.
Enough popular small map database of terrorists and special forces are on different sides of the pool, spawns different color tiles. In the center of the map is a pool at the bottom of which lie grenades.
Weapons on the map lying on the floor. Also, it can be purchased on board Thrown pool (only allowed it to plant bomb)
