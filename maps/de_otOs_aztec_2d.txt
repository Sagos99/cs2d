CT: Kick them in da ass and prevent 
    T's bombing the archiological site.

T:  Blow them away! :-)

This is a more realystic version of aztec as far
as layout and textures. Texstures used are real
aztec and halflife textures so ALL the CREDIT for
them goes to the respecting authors. Also I 
initialy painted this map over the official
CS2D Map by DC so tnx man. Sounds are also 
original aztec made. I wanna thank authors
of cs2d for making a game that's great,fun and
FREE! RESPECT ;)
