Scenario 1- 


*Counter-Terrorist; 
This is a training ground with real-life situations against you and some savage Arabs
who want to go back home, but are forced on some island filled w/ snow and odd rooms.
Your job is to kill them and ruin their dreams of bombing stuff!?

*Terrorists;
You want virgins and alcohol. At least women virgins. There are no women virgins and 
alcohol on the island. So you must kill these people who stand in your way. 


MWHAWHADWHASHAHAHADHA
